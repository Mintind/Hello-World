# Hello-World
My first repository
I'm a student 
I'm learning coding
I found github a interesting website
that's why I came here

Now I'm confused 
Because I'm not so good at English 
And I don't know what to do with GitHub...
(It looks like a website where I can write down my code)

I hope to get to know it anyway
